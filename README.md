## Overview
Gemaldegalerie AR is a technical prototype developed in partnership with museum4punkt0 and Gemaldegalerie (Berlin State Museums) investigating the use of AR for content contextualization in a museum setting. Targeted towards young audience, the application invites museum-goers to see the sides of a painting they never get to see: what is behind the layers of paint, what is the story behind each character, what it feels like to live in the era behind the frame? Its interactive features describe, but not prescribe; it does not tell museum-goers “how to look”, but “where to look”- it’s up to them to draw your their conclusions. We believe that all knowledge backgrounds deserve their own piece of memory at Gemäldegalerie.

## Technicality
The prototype was developed using Unity 2020.1.13f1.  
It was targeted and tested for iPad Pro 10.5" 2017 (iPad OS version 14 or higher). 

## Application Nagivation Flow
1. The audience picks up the tablet from the assembly points at the museum

2. The audience sees the **Welcome screen** where they can choose the language

3. The audience sees a short **Instruction screen** on how to use the app on paintings of interest

4. The audience approaches a painting of interest and scans it with the tablet

5. As the painting is successfully scanned, **buttons** for different interactions will pop up

6. The audience chooses an option and sees instruction for how to carry out that interaction. For example, peel off the painting to reveal hidden layers

7. As the audience carries out such interaction, the augmented object will change accordingly and additional information will be displayed

8. The audience can go back to **Main screen** and then explore other options
